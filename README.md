# Awesome Vibe Coding [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> Building software through natural language prompts — describe what you want, and AI generates, tests, and ships the code.

**350+ tools and resources · Updated 2026-08-27 · CC BY 4.0**

Vibe coding means that you describe software in plain English and AI builds it. [Andrej Karpathy](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383) coined the term for a way of building where you "fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists."

**How to use this list.** Each section holds one or more tables. Every entry gives the pricing model, the audience it fits, and one sentence on what the tool does. If the term is new to you, read [What is Vibe Coding?](https://www.taskade.com/blog/what-is-vibe-coding) first, then start at [Start Here](#start-here).

**How to contribute.** Add one tool per pull request. Every entry needs a live URL, a license, documentation, and a commit in the last 90 days. Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full quality bar.

## Workspace DNA: The Living Systems Architecture

Some vibe coding tools return code that you deploy and maintain. Others return a running system with a database, agents, and workflows already connected. [Taskade Genesis](https://www.taskade.com/ai/apps) calls this second model Workspace DNA, and describes a workspace as three layers rather than a set of features:

### The Three Layers

| Layer | What It Does | Why It Matters |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| **🧠 Memory (Projects & Databases)** | Persistent memory substrates — tasks, docs, files, knowledge | Not just storage. Your app's living foundation that every agent and workflow reads from. |
| **🤖 Intelligence (AI Agents)** | Minds that read your Memory, reason with context, and act with purpose | Not chatbots. Agents that understand your workspace DNA and execute autonomously 24/7. |
| **⚡ Execution (Automations & Workflows)** | Autonomous nervous system — triggers, workflows, 100+ integrations | Not simple triggers. Workflows that fire on agent decisions and write back to Memory. |

### Why This Matters for Vibe Coding

Traditional vibe coding tools generate **code** you must deploy and maintain. Workspace DNA creates **living systems** where Memory, Intelligence, and Execution are already wired together:

- **Memory is the backend** — Your workspace is the database. No schemas to design.
- **Intelligence is built in** — AI agents reason with your data, not just display it.
- **Execution runs autonomously** — Workflows fire on agent decisions and write back to Memory.
- **Collaboration is native** — Real-time editing, chat, and video across every layer.

> *"One prompt. Memory, intelligence, and execution — already wired, already running."*

### Not Features. Organs.

> *Projects are not documents. Agents are not chatbots. Automations are not triggers.*
>
> *Most tools give you features. Taskade Genesis gives you a system that remembers, reasons, and moves on its own.*

### The Taskade Genesis Loop

Every Taskade Genesis app runs a self-reinforcing cycle:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    THE TASKADE GENESIS LOOP                        │
│                                                                     │
│         🧠 MEMORY                                                   │
│        ╱         ╲                                                  │
│       ╱   feeds   ╲                                                 │
│      ╱             ╲                                                │
│  ⚡ EXECUTION ←── 🤖 INTELLIGENCE                                   │
│      ╲             ╱                                                │
│       ╲  creates  ╱                                                 │
│        ╲         ╱                                                  │
│         🧠 MEMORY  ← loop continues                                │
│                                                                     │
│  Memory feeds Intelligence → Intelligence triggers Execution →     │
│  Execution writes back to Memory → system gets smarter over time   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### What One Prompt Builds

Example: *"Build a customer feedback portal with AI scoring"*

| Step | Layer | What Happens |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | 🧠 Memory | Creates **Feedback Inbox**, **Sentiment Log**, and **Response Templates** as smart databases |
| 2 | 🤖 Intelligence | Deploys a **Scoring Agent** — reads every submission, classifies sentiment, assigns priority |
| 3 | ⚡ Execution | Fires **Slack alert** on negative feedback, **auto-categorizes** by topic, sends **follow-up email** |
| 4 | 🔄 Loop | Agent results write back to Memory → system learns patterns → responses improve over time |

**More examples:**

| Use Case | Build Time | What You Get |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| Restaurant feedback system | ~3 min | Collect reviews, Slack alerts for ratings below 4 stars, auto-respond |
| Yoga studio booking | ~5 min | Calendar sync, payments, automatic class confirmations |
| Freelancer CRM | ~5 min | Pipeline tracking, follow-up emails, deal stage automations |
| Inventory tracker | ~7 min | Stock levels, auto-email suppliers when products run low |
| [Business-in-a-Box](https://www.taskade.com/blog/business-in-a-box-genesis) | ~15 min | CRM + Finance + Support + Content + Client Portal — all connected |

## AI App Builders


Tools that generate complete applications from natural language descriptions.

### AI App Builder Comparison Matrix

The fastest way to pick: do you want **code you own and deploy yourself**, or a **living app that ships already wired** (database, sign-in, agents)? All facts current for 2026; pricing *models* shown (exact dollars shift — check each vendor's page).

| Builder | Code export | Backend included | Auth built-in | Pricing model | Cost to run a published app | Best for |
|---------|:-----------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|---------------|------------------------------|----------|
| 🔥 **[Taskade Genesis](https://www.taskade.com/ai/apps)** | No | ✅ Yes — workspace *is* the database | ✅ Yes — no-code sign-in | Free tier + credits | 🟢 **Zero — published apps run free** | Non-technical teams who want a living app + database + login in one place |
| [Bolt](https://bolt.new) | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Partial — bring your own Supabase | ⚠️ Partial — via Supabase | Free tier + per-token | Metered (Supabase backend) | Fast full-stack MVPs you can export and self-host |
| [Lovable](https://lovable.dev) | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Partial — bring your own Supabase | ⚠️ Partial — via Supabase | Free tier + per-credit | Metered (Supabase backend) | Polished React apps you own, chat-built backend |
| [Replit](https://replit.com) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes — native Postgres | ✅ Yes — Replit Auth | Free tier + per-seat + usage | Metered (deployment compute) | A full IDE with native DB + hosting in one place |
| [v0](https://v0.dev) | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Partial — external | ⚠️ Partial — external | Free tier + per-token | Metered (Vercel hosting) | Frontend-first React/Next.js + shadcn UI |
| [Base44](https://base44.com) | ⚠️ Partial — frontend, one-way | ✅ Yes — native | ✅ Yes | Free tier + per-credit | Metered (integration credits) | All-in-one no-code with native DB + auth |

> **The honest tradeoff:** code generators (Bolt, Lovable, v0) hand you **source you own and host anywhere** — but you wire up the backend, auth, and ongoing run-cost yourself. **Taskade Genesis** doesn't export code; instead the app ships live with database, sign-in, and AI agents already connected, and **published apps run at zero credits**.

### MCP Design Principles

Best practices for building MCP servers that agents can actually use. Based on [Jeremiah Lowin's](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp) research and practitioner experience.

| Principle | What To Do | Why It Matters |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| **Design for outcomes** | Name tools by what they achieve (`get_customer_status`), not HTTP operations (`post_api_v2_customers`) | Agents think in goals, not API specs. Outcome-oriented tools get selected more reliably. |
| **Flatten arguments** | Use simple, flat parameters instead of nested JSON schemas | Nested objects confuse agents. Flat args = fewer hallucinated parameters. |
| **Keep tool count under 50** | Curate ruthlessly. Remove tools agents never select. | Performance degrades sharply above ~50 tools. Less is more for agent accuracy. |
| **Errors are prompts** | Return helpful error messages that guide the agent to self-correct | `"Missing required field: customer_id (use list_customers to find it)"` > `"400 Bad Request"` |
| **Don't auto-convert OpenAPI** | Hand-design agent-facing tools instead of auto-generating from REST specs | Auto-generated servers inherit REST assumptions that confuse agents. |

> **Anti-patterns to avoid:** Kitchen-sink servers with 200+ tools, nested JSON schemas, generic CRUD wrappers, and treating MCP as "REST with extra steps." Start with [FastMCP](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp) to build MCP servers the right way.

### Agent Memory & Context

## Best Practices & Workflows

Practical techniques for effective vibe coding, sourced from practitioners and the developer community.

### Prompting Techniques

Strategies for getting better results from AI coding tools.

| Technique | Description | Source |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Pseudocode-First** | Write pseudocode or step-by-step logic before asking AI to implement. Reduces errors and gives AI clear intent. | [HN Community](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43953633) |
| **Progressive Prompting** | Start with high-level architecture, then drill into components. Don't try to build everything in one prompt. | [AI Prompting Guide →](https://www.taskade.com/blog/ai-prompting-guide) |
| **Function-Signature Method** | Define function signatures and types first, then ask AI to implement the bodies. Type safety guides the AI. | [HN Community](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43953633) |
| **Doc Embedding** | Paste documentation snippets into your prompt so the AI uses the correct APIs and conventions. | Practitioner consensus |
| **Test-First Prompting** | Write tests before asking AI to implement code. Tests become the specification. | [HN Mega-Thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46352875) |

### Session & Context Management

Keep AI productive across long coding sessions.

| Practice | Description | Source |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **Preserve Session Logs** | Configure `cleanupPeriodDays: 99999` in Claude Code to keep JSONL logs. Link sessions to git commits for auditability. | [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/claude-code-logs/) |
| **Know When to Reset** | Start fresh when you notice "context rot" — AI repeating mistakes or losing track of the codebase. Time-box sessions. | [Armin Ronacher](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/12/22/a-year-of-vibes/) |
| **DISCOVERIES.md Pattern** | Keep a retrospective file of approaches that failed and why. Feed it to new sessions so the AI doesn't repeat mistakes. | [HN Mega-Thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46352875) |
| **Checkpoint with Git** | Commit frequently before asking AI to make large changes. Makes it easy to revert if the AI goes off track. | Practitioner consensus |
| **Split Complex Tasks** | Break work into small, focused tasks rather than asking for everything at once. Each task = one clear objective. | [Multi-Agent Best Practices →](https://www.taskade.com/blog/best-practices-for-building-multi-agent-ai-teams) |

### Code Quality & Review

Maintain quality when AI generates your code.

| Practice | Description | Source |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **Always Review Diffs** | Never blindly accept AI-generated code. Read every diff, especially security-sensitive changes. | [Armin Ronacher](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/12/22/a-year-of-vibes/) |
| **Steering Files** | Use .cursorrules, AGENTS.md, or CLAUDE.md to set coding standards, conventions, and constraints. | [Documentation & Templates](#documentation--templates) |
| **Lock Dependencies** | Specify exact versions in your steering files. AI may suggest outdated or incompatible package versions. | Practitioner consensus |
| **Run Tests Before & After** | Always run your test suite before and after AI modifications. Catch regressions immediately. | Practitioner consensus |

### Harness Engineering

The 2026 meta-skill: designing the scaffolding around AI models for maximum agent effectiveness.

| Principle | What It Means | Source |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| **Fewer tools > more tools** | Agent accuracy drops sharply above ~50 tools. Generic tools (bash, file read/write) outperform specialized ones. | Practitioner consensus |
| **File system as memory** | Use markdown files (CLAUDE.md, DISCOVERIES.md) as persistent memory instead of complex databases. Agents read files naturally. | [Documentation & Templates](#documentation--templates) |
| **Verify, don't trust** | Always validate agent output. Plan mode achieves 2-3x higher success on complex tasks. Diff review and test suites are non-negotiable. | Practitioner consensus |
| **Context > prompts** | Progressive context disclosure (agents discover context via --help, file reading) beats pre-loaded mega-prompts. | [Claude Code Docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) |
| **Simplify relentlessly** | Each model generation makes simpler harnesses more effective. Complexity you add today becomes drag tomorrow. | [The Bitter Lesson](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html) |

> **Key insight:** "The model is no longer the bottleneck. The harness is." — The best vibe coders in 2026 aren't prompt engineers; they're harness engineers.

### Context Engineering

The evolution beyond prompt engineering — designing the information architecture that surrounds AI agents. [Context Engineering Guide →](https://github.com/coleam00/context-engineering-intro)

| Technique | Description | Source |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Steering Files** | CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, AGENTS.md — project-level context that persists across sessions. The most impactful single change you can make. | [Documentation & Templates](#documentation--templates) |
| **Progressive Disclosure** | Don't dump everything into the prompt. Let agents discover context via file reading, --help, and tool exploration. | [Claude Code Docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) |
| **Context Budgeting** | Allocate context window strategically: 40% task, 30% codebase, 20% examples, 10% constraints. Measure what gets cut. | Practitioner consensus |
| **Knowledge Graphs as Context** | Feed structured relationships (not just documents) to agents. DISCOVERIES.md, architecture diagrams, dependency maps. | [HN Mega-Thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46352875) |

> **Taskade Genesis shortcut:** Workspace DNA *is* context engineering — your projects, agents, and workflows form a persistent knowledge graph that every app reads from automatically.

### Spec-Driven Development

Write specifications first, then let agents implement. Rigor migrates from code review to specs and tests.

| Technique | Description | Source |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **TDD as Specification** | Write tests before asking agents to implement. Tests prevent agents from "cheating" by writing code that passes trivially. | [HN Mega-Thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46352875) |
| **Risk Tiering** | Match verification effort to blast radius. Low-risk (UI copy) → quick review. High-risk (auth, payments) → full test suite + manual review. | Practitioner consensus |
| **Decision Tables** | For complex business logic, define all input/output combinations in a table before implementing. Agents excel at table-to-code. | Practitioner consensus |

### From Idea to Deployed App

```

## Security & Pre-Deploy Checks

The most common objection to vibe coding is "the app demos well and ships insecure". Run these checks before you put real users on an AI-built app. See also the [Security & Cost Terms](#security--cost-terms) glossary.

### Pre-Deploy Checklist

| Check | What To Do | Why It Matters |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| **Secrets out of the code** | Move every key and password to environment variables. Scan the repository history. | AI scaffolds often hard-code credentials to make a demo work. |
| **Real authorization, not placeholder auth** | Test that user A cannot read user B's records by changing an ID in the URL. | IDOR is the most common flaw in AI-generated apps. |
| **Row-level security on** | Enable RLS in Postgres or Supabase and write a policy for every table. | Access rules then hold even when the app code has a bug. |
| **Input validation at the edge** | Validate and size-limit every request body and query parameter on the server. | The model writes the happy path first. Hostile input comes later. |
| **Dependency audit** | Run `npm audit`, `pip-audit`, or the equivalent, and pin versions. | AI suggests packages from training data, some of which are outdated or typosquatted. |
| **Rate limits and cost caps** | Add rate limits on public endpoints and a hard spend cap on every AI API key. | One public form plus one unmetered key equals a surprise bill. |
| **Agent QA pass** | Run an automated agent or a browser MCP against the deployed app before launch. | Catches the flows nobody clicked through by hand. |

## Vibe Coding Philosophies

### From Code to Outcomes

Traditional coding requires you to think in code — variables, functions, syntax, frameworks. Vibe coding inverts this: you think in outcomes, and AI handles the implementation.

#### Key Principles

1. **Describe, don't code** — Natural language is the new programming language
2. **Outcomes over output** — Focus on what you want, not how to build it
3. **Iterate through conversation** — Refine with prompts, not debugging
4. **Ship fast** — Minutes to deployment, not months
5. **Trust the vibes** — Let AI make implementation decisions

#### The Evolution

| Generation | Approach | Who Can Build |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| Traditional Coding | Write code manually | Developers only |
| Low-Code | Visual builders + code | Developers + technical users |
| No-Code | Visual builders only | Technical users |
| **Vibe Coding** | Natural language | **Everyone** |

### Exploration and Production

The community uses two approaches. Each one fits a different situation.

| Approach | When to Use | Mindset | Outcome |
|----------|-------------|---------|---------|
| **Exploration Mode** | New projects, prototyping, learning | "Let AI surprise me. I'll evaluate results." | Fast iteration, creative solutions, rapid learning |
| **Production Mode** | Existing codebases, critical systems | "I know what I want. AI helps me build it faster." | Predictable output, maintainable code, team alignment |

**Key Insight:** The same tools work differently depending on your mode. In exploration, you give AI freedom to architect. In production, you provide constraints and specifications.

- [Build Without Permission](https://www.taskade.com/blog/build-without-permission) — The philosophy behind rapid experimentation

### Agentic Workflows

The evolution from code assistance to autonomous agents represents a fundamental shift in how we build software.

**The Spectrum:**
1. **Code Completion** (Copilot) — Suggests next lines
2. **Code Generation** (ChatGPT) — Writes functions from descriptions
3. **Agentic Coding** (Cursor, Devin) — Plans, implements, and iterates
4. **Living Systems** (Taskade Genesis) — Memory + Intelligence + Execution in one organism

**Learn more:**

- [Single vs Multi-Agent Systems](https://www.taskade.com/blog/single-agent-systems-versus-multi-agent-ai-teams) — When to orchestrate multiple agents

### The Middle Loop

A new category of engineering work is emerging between the inner loop (writing code) and the outer loop (shipping to users):

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  INNER LOOP        MIDDLE LOOP         OUTER LOOP      │
│  (Code)            (Orchestrate)       (Ship)           │
│                                                         │
│  Write code    →   Delegate to agents  →  Deploy        │
│  Debug         →   Evaluate output     →  Monitor       │
│  Test          →   Maintain coherence  →  Iterate       │
│                                                         │
│  Shrinking ←──    THE NEW WORK    ──→  Unchanged       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Middle loop skills:** Decomposing tasks into agent-sized units, evaluating agent output quality, maintaining architectural coherence across parallel agents, and knowing when to intervene vs. let agents iterate.

> **Taskade Genesis shortcut:** Taskade Genesis handles the middle loop for you — Memory, Intelligence, and Execution are pre-wired. Describe your app, and the system orchestrates the rest.

## Glossary

Key terms in the vibe coding ecosystem.

### Core Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Vibe Coding** | Building software by describing what you want in natural language, letting AI handle implementation. Coined by [Andrej Karpathy](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383). |
| **Living Systems** | Applications that evolve with your data, learn from patterns, and act autonomously — Memory, Intelligence, and Execution wired as one organism. |
| **Workspace DNA** | Architecture where your workspace (projects, databases, automations) becomes the backend for AI-generated apps. [Learn more →](https://www.taskade.com/blog/how-workspace-dna-works) |
| **Prompt-to-App** | The workflow of generating a complete application from a single natural language prompt. |
| **Prompt-to-System** | The next evolution beyond prompt-to-app: one prompt creates a complete system with backend, agents, and workflows — not just a UI. Pioneered by [Taskade Genesis](https://www.taskade.com/ai/apps). |
| **AI Agents** | Autonomous AI systems that can understand context, make decisions, and execute tasks without human intervention. [Learn more →](https://www.taskade.com/blog/what-are-ai-agents) |

### Taskade Genesis Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Taskade Genesis** | Taskade's AI app builder that creates living systems from natural language. One prompt generates a complete app with Memory, Intelligence, and Execution layers pre-wired. [Try it →](https://www.taskade.com/ai/apps) |
| **The Taskade Genesis Loop** | The self-reinforcing cycle at the heart of every Taskade Genesis app: Memory feeds Intelligence → Intelligence triggers Execution → Execution writes back to Memory → system gets smarter over time. |
| **Not Features. Organs.** | The Taskade Genesis design philosophy: projects are not documents (they're Memory), agents are not chatbots (they're Intelligence), automations are not triggers (they're Execution). Each is an organ in a living system. |
| **Business-in-a-Box** | A complete business system built from a single Taskade Genesis prompt: CRM + Finance + Support + Content + Client Portal, all interconnected through Workspace DNA. [Learn more →](https://www.taskade.com/blog/business-in-a-box-genesis) |
| **EVE** | Taskade's unified AI assistant that orchestrates agents, workflows, and memory across your entire workspace. Available in every Taskade Genesis app, chat, and automation. |
| **Clone and Customize** | The Taskade Genesis workflow: browse community apps, clone any app with one click, customize it for your use case. Every cloned app inherits the original's Workspace DNA. [Browse apps →](https://www.taskade.com/community) |

### Development Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Agentic IDE** | Development environment where AI acts as an autonomous collaborator, not just an assistant. Examples: Cursor, Antigravity, Devin Desktop, Kiro. |
| **Agentic Workflow** | Multi-step processes where AI agents coordinate to complete complex tasks. |
| **Code Generation** | AI producing actual source code that developers can modify and deploy. |
| **Context Window** | The amount of text (measured in tokens) an AI can consider at once. Larger = better codebase understanding. |
| **Human-in-the-Loop** | AI workflow where humans approve or modify AI actions before execution. Common in Cline and Claude Code. |
| **Context Engineering** | The discipline of designing the information architecture around AI agents — steering files, progressive disclosure, and context budgeting. The 2026 evolution beyond prompt engineering. |
| **Harness Engineering** | Designing the scaffolding (tools, verification, memory) around AI models. The harness, not the model, is the 2026 bottleneck. |

### Architecture Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** | Open standard for connecting AI tools to external data sources and services. Created by Anthropic. |
| **MCP Server** | A service that exposes data or functionality to AI tools via the Model Context Protocol. |
| **Agent Memory** | Persistent storage that allows AI agents to remember context across sessions. |
| **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** | Technique where AI retrieves relevant documents before generating responses. |
| **Embeddings** | Vector representations of text that enable semantic search and similarity matching. |

### Workflow Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **No-Code** | Building software without writing traditional code, using visual builders or natural language. |
| **Low-Code** | Development approach combining visual builders with some traditional coding. |
| **Multi-Agent Orchestration** | Coordinating multiple AI agents to work together on complex problems. |
| **Spec-Driven Development** | Writing specifications that AI uses to generate and maintain code. Used by Amazon Kiro. |
| **Steering Files** | Configuration files (like .cursorrules or AGENTS.md) that guide AI behavior in a project. |
| **Workspace Backend** | Using a collaborative workspace as the database and API layer for applications. |
| **The Middle Loop** | The new category of engineering work between writing code (inner loop) and shipping to users (outer loop): delegating to agents, evaluating output, and maintaining coherence. |
| **Token Trap** | Pricing model where AI tools charge per token/credit, making costs unpredictable. Contrast with flat-rate pricing where published apps consume zero credits. |
| **llms.txt** | An emerging standard for making websites AI-friendly by providing structured context at a known URL path. [Spec →](https://llmstxt.org/) |

### Security & Cost Terms

The vocabulary every non-technical builder should know before shipping an AI-generated app.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Token Burn (Credit Burn)** | The ongoing consumption of paid tokens or credits each time an AI tool generates, edits, or runs your app, which makes monthly costs hard to predict. Contrast with published Taskade Genesis apps, which run at zero credits. |
| **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)** | A flaw where an app trusts a user-supplied ID (like `?id=123`) to fetch a record without checking the user is allowed to see it — so changing the number exposes other people's data. A common gap in AI-generated apps that skip authorization checks. |
| **RLS (Row-Level Security)** | A database feature (notably in Postgres and Supabase) that enforces which rows each user can read or write at the data layer, so access rules hold even if the app's own code has a bug. The safety net every AI-built app should enable. |
| **Placeholder Auth** | Login or permission code an AI scaffolds as a stub or hard-coded shortcut to make a demo work — it looks like real security but verifies nothing, and must be replaced before shipping. |
| **Context Rot** | The gradual decline in an AI's output quality as a chat or codebase outgrows its context window, causing it to forget earlier decisions, contradict itself, or reintroduce bugs you already fixed. |
| **The Vibe Coding Gap** | The distance between an AI-generated app that demos beautifully and one that's actually production-ready — the security, error handling, edge cases, and maintenance the prompt-to-app moment leaves unfinished. |
| **One-Shot vs Iterative Generation** | Two ways to build with AI: one-shot produces a whole app from a single prompt (fast but rigid), while iterative generation refines it through back-and-forth (slower but easier to steer and correct). |
